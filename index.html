    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Thomas Brown, also known online as Lifeport-z.<br><br>
        I’m an aspiring 3D Environment, Prop, and Poster Artist with about 3 years of experience using Blender for modeling and animating.<br><br>
        While I’m still an amateur and continuously learning, I’m deeply passionate about 3D art and dedicated to improving my skills every day. Creating detailed and immersive 3D products that bring digital worlds and stories to life is something I truly enjoy.<br><br>
        My work ranges from building complex environments and designing unique props to producing striking posters. I believe that combining creativity with technical skills is key to making impactful digital art, and I’m committed to developing both sides.<br><br>
        I understand that I’m at the beginning of my journey, and I welcome constructive feedback and collaboration to help me grow as an artist. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new, and I’m excited about what the future holds.<br><br>
        Feel free to explore my portfolio and connect with me if you’re interested in working together or sharing insights. Follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/lifeportz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifeport-z</a> to see my latest work and progress.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <div class="goals-content">
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to work on games that create powerful emotional experiences, like the <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Souls</em> series. I want to be part of teams that craft worlds players remember for a lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constantly pushing myself to improve so that no matter how challenging the task, my work is always of the highest quality. I aim for a standard where every asset I create feels intentional, polished, and impactful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technical mastery, I hope to find and build friendships within the game development community — people who are kind, caring, and passionate about creating meaningful work together.

            <p>“I have known Tom for over 3 years within the underground VR Club scene, and his work has consistently set a new standard. Before experiencing his creations, the VR club environments often lacked the immersive detail and technical polish that truly elevates a DJ set.</p>
            <p>Since joining and DJing in a number of his meticulously crafted clubs, and even helping him test them before events to ensure lighting and sound are performing as required, I've seen firsthand his incredible talent. Tom's attention to detail and passion for his projects are truly top-notch! He builds incredibly realistic underground clubs, and over the years, he has dedicated himself to designing his own assets and doing extensive work on lighting systems. The way he crafts dynamic lighting, for instance, truly transforms the mood of the space and makes each event feel unique and vibrant, significantly enhancing the entire VR club experience for both DJs and attendees.</p>
            <p>I would wholeheartedly consider Tom one of the best world creators VRC has. His dedication to creating captivating and technically sound environments is unparalleled, and I'm always blown away by his work. I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking truly immersive and high-quality VR club experiences.</p>
